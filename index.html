					Ever wish you could easily access the anime you love all in one place? Well, following Sony’s $1.175 billion acquisition of Crunchyroll last August, plans are now being put in motion to unify the streaming service with Sony’s pre-existing anime streaming service, Funimation. The two will operate under the Crunchyroll brand. Notably, Funimation’s simulcast and simuldub services, which brought new anime subbed and dubbed to fans in a timely manner, is making the move to Crunchyroll. However, while both services have always provided fans with same or close to same day access to current run series, a huge portion of Funimation’s vast library of legacy titles are also being added to Crunchyroll. No matter what genre you dig, there’s bound to be something on this new mega streaming service for you. Here are five suggestions to get you started on your journey into the depths of everything Crunchyroll has to offer.

				<h2>Fandom’s Top Anime Communities Of 2021</h2>
				<span class="data-postagem">Jan 02,2022</span>

				<p>
					Our results for this year’s top anime communities were largely unsurprising. One Piece came out on top—possibly because many people were wondering if 981 episodes (and counting) are worth it—then Naruto and My Hero Academia sit at second and third place, respectively. My Hero Academia has only been out in English since 2018, and no matter where you fall in the sub vs dub debate, it’s impressive that the series sits at number three for how new it is. If you’ve been looking for a new series to watch, consult this list, check the fan pages and see for yourself if they live up to the hype!
